# Schema verification

- Challenge starter file: `<schema_name.gql`: Here the student can work on a solution.
- Challenge initial file: `<schema_name>-initial.gql`: Contains the initial state of the schema. Should be identical with the committed content of `<schema_name>.gql`.
- Challenge complete file: `<schema_name>-complete.gql`: The suggested solution. Used for generating schema tests for verifying the solution that the student has proposed.
